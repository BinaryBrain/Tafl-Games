TODO List
=========

Socket.io
---------

- If a player is invited into 2 groups, he shouldn't be able to join both.

Interface
---------

- Metro/Play Store style?

Games
-----

- Find a way to import them (require(name) ?)
- Find a way to destroy them
- Find a way to make them modular (require())
- Create and API or a SDK/Toolkit (remember PONG!)

Cleaning the code
-----------------

- Put communications with socket.io in another file
